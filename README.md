Football Talent Scouting Platform

📌 Overview

The Football Talent Scouting Platform is a digital ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between undiscovered football talent and professional scouts, clubs, and agents. It provides players with a standardized profile, video analysis, and verification methods to increase their visibility and credibility in the football industry.

Football scouting is often:

Expensive & Inefficient – Traditional scouting methods require extensive travel and manual assessments.

Lacking Exposure – Talented players, especially in underrepresented regions, struggle to get noticed.

Unstandardized – No universal evaluation system exists for young or amateur players.

💡 Solution

Our platform offers:

Player Profiles – Standardized digital CVs with stats, videos, and endorsements.

AI & Video Analysis – AI-powered insights from uploaded match footage.

Verification System – Multi-layered verification using club validation, coach endorsements, and AI-driven assessments.

Club & Agent Portal – A database for clubs and scouts to discover talent efficiently.
